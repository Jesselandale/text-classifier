# Text Topic Classifier

This is a simple text classification model built using machine learning. It classifies text into one of two categories: **Space** or **Baseball**.

## Description

This model uses a machine learning algorithm to classify text into one of the two categories: Space or Baseball. It uses the Naive Bayes algorithm, and the model has been trained using the **20 Newsgroups dataset**.

The app provides a simple interface where users can input a text, and the model predicts whether the text is related to space or baseball.
